        <h1>HIKER</h1>

        <p>Hiker is a location tracking application meant to be used by hikers.
            <br/>The goal of the application was to prevent hikers from getting lost.
            <br/>Users would pick contacts that would recieve their location at set intervals.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="aligncenter">
            <img src="images/login.PNG" alt="" style="width: 128px;height: 256px;">
            <img src="images/contactcreate.PNG" alt="" style="width: 128px;height: 256px;">
        </p>
        
        <p>I implemented contact creation and removal for the application and also
        assisted with user authentication and setting up the databse</p>
        <br>

        <h1>That's all for now!</h1>
